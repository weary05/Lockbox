Lockbox is a simple program for holding passwords and account data safely in an easy to find format.
To create a new storage click the "create new" button in the opening window. This will allow you to define the password and file location for your storage.

Accounts recorded with the program will be displayed on the left side of the window below the search box, the data can be accessed by clicking on the account name you want.

To add a new account, click the "Add New" button, fill out the data you want to record then press save.
To close the application click the white x in the top right corner.

Currently there is no way to resize the window or minise it.
In the unlikely event you want to take the code and do anything with it, feel free, so long as credit is given for the origin if it is uploaded anywhere.
